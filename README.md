# Introduction
Join me as we journey through the realm of data, focusing on diverse data professionals. I've split this project into two main sections: data manipulation and exploratory analysis.

# Data Origin
This project features two distinct tables. The initial table, "Salaries," was sourced from Kaggle, while the second table was extracted from Wikipedia.

# DS_Salaries on Kaggle
The dataset ds_salaries.csv, provided by Ruchi Bhatia on Kaggle, contains salary information for individuals working in data science roles or related fields. Each entry includes various features such as:

- work_year: The year of the recorded salary.
- experience_level: Job experience level categorized as EN (Entry-level / Junior), MI (Mid-level / Intermediate), SE (Senior-level / Expert), or EX (Executive-level / Director).
- employment_type: Employment type categorized as PT (Part-time), FT (Full-time), CT (Contract), or FL (Freelance).
- job_title: Job role during the recorded year.
- employee_residence: Primary country of residence (ISO 3166 country code) during the work year.
- remote_ratio: Remote work percentage categorized as 0 (On-site), 50 (Hybrid), or 100 (Remote).
- company_location: Country of employer's main office or contracting branch (ISO 3166 country code).
- company_size: Average workforce size during the year categorized as S (small), M (medium), or L (large).
- salary: Gross salary amount.
- salary_currency: Salary currency (ISO 4217 currency code).
- salary_in_usd: Salary in USD (converted via FX rate divided by average USD rate for the respective year).
